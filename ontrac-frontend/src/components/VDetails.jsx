/* 
this page should look similar to the Review page of the other workflow... 
we want to show User B the task title and the task description
and preferrably the other persons wallet address
but i dont know if we have the code that stores that data in a variable yet.

then there should be 2 buttons: 
1 that says Task not yet complete which directs back to VDashboard
another that says Task is complete which  routes to VSuccess.jsx
