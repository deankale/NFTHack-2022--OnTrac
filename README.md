# NFTHack-2022--OnTrac
this is the official ETHGlobal NFTHackathon 2022 submission for our project "OnTrac"



# TL;DR How it Works:
1. User initiates a task to complete, connects their wallet address + the address of a trusted partner
2. User picks a deadline and a max price (in crypto-tokens) they are willing to lose if they fail
3. With the help of [SuperFluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/home)'s SDK will stream money using SuperFluid from User's wallet into a vault at a steady rate until the deadline hits
4. If they pass, they get their money back and a minted NFT, if they give up early or fail to complete, the money moves from the vault into their trusted partner's wallet and they get no NFT.
5. OnTrac has potential to restructure independent learning online, freelance work agreements, and promote a culture of self-improvement backed by science and code.


# OnTrac's Vision
Why do most New Year's Resolutions fail? 
Why is it easier to go to the gym with a friend than it is by yourself? 
Why do we fantasize of doing things that we KNOW will improve our lives, but simply never get started on them? 

Behavioural science shows us that it's NOT because we are lazy or don't care about our futures, it's because we lack a system of accountability, consequences, and rewards.

NFTs, tokenomics and web3 Dapps have revolutionized value systems in our increasingly digital-focused world. The team at OnTrac embraces the expanding culture around NFT-sharing and community driven art collecting, however, we also wanted to explore how NFTs could be not just digital art, but digital accolades.

It all begins with a fulfilling task. 

For example: 
Arjun dislikes his job, but he hates updating his resume even more. Arjun has been putting off doing that for weeks now, however he won't get a new job unless he updates his resume. Arjun needs a plan and someone to hold him accountable to the task. 

Arjun logs onto OnTrac and gives the Dapp his wallet address plus the address of his trustworthy friend Bara. Andy specifies what his task is, what it takes to complete the task, his deadline, and the amount of cryptocurrency he is willing to lose if he doesn't complete the task in time. Behind the scenes, a smart contract will stream money out of Arjun's wallet and into a vault at a set flow rate until the deadline is reached. 

Now Arjun feels a sense of urgency to get this task done quickly! If Arjun doesn't complete the task by the deadline, or if he chooses to give up, the money will move from the vault into Bara's wallet address.

If Arjun completes the task, it is reviewed by his partner Bara. If Bara agrees that the task is finished, the vault money moves back into Arjun's wallet. As a reward for finishing the task, the Dapp will mint him his own exclusive NFT. These NFT rewards will be crucial to the OnTrac culture, as OnTrac users can show off their "Trophy rooms" of NFTs!

We have also implemented a 3rd party "Judge" that is optional. The Judge is an extra layer of verification; it can be a real person or it can be a contract writing it's own custom logic. This opens up a wealth of possibilities for creating a more trustless system, as online organizations that provide certifications (Coursera, Udemy) can integrate their API's into the Judge contract and set their own rules and their own NFT rewards.

# The Future of OnTrac
Not only is this app a novel way for people to collect NFT's, it promotes a culture of well-being and accountability for users of all ages and lifestyles. 

Additionally, this can become a new form of payment system adopted by online educational tools such as Coursera and Udemy, who currently use subscription-based or one-time-payment models. New "Web 3 tools" allow developers to get far more granular and sophisticated with the logic behind digital agreements than subscription-based models can. OnTrac is the first of it's kind to prove this.
